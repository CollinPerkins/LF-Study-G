                <h2>How to Get Job Ready With 1 FCC Certificate, 3 Projects, 2 Courses, and 10 Books</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Do you want to be job ready (for a junior role) without finishing all three certifications? Want to short-circuit the process and get this done quick without getting laughed out of interviews?</p>


                <p>Are you thinking "I'll just finish the frontend certification" and start applying?</p>

                <p>You're looking at the wrong certification to get prepared and I'll tell you why. The frontend certification does NOT teach you any of the real world skills that go along with programming that you'll need on the job. It doesn't teach you
                    how to work in an editor on your own machine. It doesn't teach you how to run a build process. It doesn't teach you how to share your code in a git repository. And, it doesn't teach you how to deploy your code to a real server on the
                    net.</p>

                <p>Have no fear - there IS a FCC certification that will get you much, much closer to your goal. Combine it with just a few other resources and you can get there. The backend certification is the one you want to be aiming for.</p>

                <p>Finish this list - and you'll walk into interviews with a lot more confidence, and a much better chance of landing that job.</p>

                                        <p>CS50 is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students with a diversity of technological background and experience. CS50 for AP Computer
                                            Science Principles is an adaptation of CS50 specifically tailored to align with the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework. The course’s assignments, materials, and resources are all identical to
                                            the version of the course taught at the college-level, albeit adapted to suit a secondary school audience.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Among this course’s objectives is to supply you with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of the discipline of computer science. We will do so using programming in several different languages as a vehicle to introduce these fundamentals, including
                                            such topics as algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies. Though the course is programming-heavy, it should be stressed that this is not a “programming course”; rather, this course
                                            should be considered one of problem-solving, creativity, and exploration. By year’s end, you will have a richer understanding of the key principles of the discipline of computer science. You will be able to
                                            speak intelligently about how computers work and how they enable us to become better problem-solvers, and will hopefully be able to communicate that knowledge to others.</p>

In this course, we will introduce the essential concepts of the MEAN stack using a fast-paced, learn-by- doing approach. As a concrete example, we will walk through building a retail application.
                                                    This online store will enable users to search for products, add them to their cart, and check out using Stripe, an online payment processor. You’ll build your own REST API (Representational State Transfer
                                                    Application Programming Interface) server from scratch using MongoDB schema design principles, as well as a web application using AngularJS and a hybrid mobile application using the Ionic framework.</p>

                                                <p>As I authored this book, I specifically had two types of developers in mind. I assume both types already have an intermediate to advanced knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The first developer is someone
                                                    who has a good handle on JavaScript or jQuery, but has really never taken the time to understand the purpose and value of a library like jQuery (the reason for its rhyme, if you will). Equipped with
                                                    the knowledge from this book, that developer should fully be able to understand the value provided by jQuery for scripting the DOM. And not just the value, but how jQuery abstracts the DOM and where
                                                    and why jQuery is filling the gaps. The second type of developer is an engineer who is tasked with scripting HTML documents that will only run in modern browsers or that will get ported to native code
                                                    for multiple OS's and device distributions (e.g. PhoneGap) and needs to avoid the overhead (i.e. size or size v.s. use) of a library</p>

                                                <p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are both exciting and a fascinating topic to explore in any programming language.</p>

                                                <p>One reason for this is that they help us build upon the combined experience of many developers that came before us and ensure we structure our code in an optimized way, meeting the needs of problems we're
                                                    attempting to solve.</p>

                                                <p>Design patterns also provide us a common vocabulary to describe solutions. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution
                                                    in code form to others.</p>

                                                <p>In this book we will explore applying both classical and modern design patterns to the JavaScript programming language.</p>
